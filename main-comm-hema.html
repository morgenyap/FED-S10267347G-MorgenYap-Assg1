      <h3>Why She Joined FoodAID</h3>
      <p>Hema joined FoodAID because she wanted to try something new that wasn't offered in her secondary school. Among the 8 Community Service CCAs, FoodAID stood out to her because the food aspect resonated with her 🥰.</p>

      <h3>Favorite Principle</h3>
      <p>A quote Hema lives by is:
        "And if you can't do it, if you aren't willing to keep looking for light in the darkest of places without stopping, even when it seems impossible, you will never succeed.” – Amelia Shepherd 🫀🫶🏽.
        This inspires her to keep pushing forward and seek light even in challenging times.</p>
