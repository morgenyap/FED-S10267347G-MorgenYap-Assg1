# FoodAID Club Website
*"One Small Community, One Big Heart ❤️"*

## Project Overview
The **FoodAID Club Website** is a personal project created as part of my journey with the **FoodAID Club** at Ngee Ann Polytechnic. This website serves to showcase the club’s mission, ongoing events, and its impact on the community. FoodAID Club focuses on providing food assistance to lower-income families, and as an active member, I have been privileged to be part of meaningful events that have significantly impacted the lives of many people in our community. This website aims to highlight the club’s core values, promote its events, and inspire others to join the cause.

This website is my way of giving back to a club that has taught me so much about empathy, teamwork, and the power of serving others. By leveraging my skills as a **Diploma in IT (DipIT)** student, I aim to ensure that the FoodAID Club’s story and mission reach a wider audience, inspiring others to join hands in making a difference.

As a **Diploma in IT (DipIT)** student, I wanted to apply my skills in **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to give back to the club that has given me so much. Through this project, I not only aim to provide the club with a professional online presence but also to enhance my technical skills while making a meaningful contribution to a cause I am passionate about.

**FoodAID** was my first-ever community service CCA, and it is one of the 7 clubs in the community service cluster at Ngee Ann Polytechnic. Stepping forward and joining this club was the best decision I ever made, as it allowed me to gain exposure to real-world challenges and helped me understand and sympathize with lower-income individuals and families. The experiences I’ve gained have truly shaped my perspective on life and strengthened my desire to contribute to society.

The website features multiple sections that allow users to:
- Learn about FoodAID Club's mission and values.
- Explore past and ongoing events like **Project 100=50**.
- View galleries showcasing the club's community impact.
- Find opportunities to volunteer and contact the club directly.
- Know the committee members and who our beneficiaries are.
