      <h3>Fun Facts</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Ah Kao dislikes strawberries 🍓 and strawberry-flavored food, as he always says there’s a “grass taste” in strawberries!</li>
        <li>He enjoys cooking during his free time 👨‍🍳 and loves photographing memories 📸. (The airport is his comfort place!! ✈️ - true Aerospace student indeed!)</li>
        <li>Ah Kao's favorite food is Hotplate Tofu! He loves anything tofu-like—"Mostly the egg tofu kind," as he calls it.</li>
        <li>He also loves Katsu Don (because of the half-soggy and fried chicken drenched in sauce), Mala, and Chili Oil Dumplings! 🥟</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Why He Joined FoodAID</h3>

      <h3>Favorite Principle</h3>
      <p>While he doesn't have a specific quote 🎤 he resonates with, Ah Kao always observes this principle: <strong>"Do your best in everything you do."</strong> 😎</p>
